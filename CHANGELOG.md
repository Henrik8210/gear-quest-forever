# Changelog

Forked from [GearQuest](https://github.com/Henrik8210/gear-quest) `v0.1.1-beta.3-bcc` for **World of Warcraft: Forever**.

## v1.1.6

The window title reads **GearQuest Forever v1.1.6**.

**A worn piece no longer scores 0**

The score bar printed 0 for gear you were wearing when that piece was not on your faction's hunt list. The item tooltip still showed the stats. Players saw it on necks, rings, trinkets, and on crafted leather that both factions can make. An empty slot is still 0 and still says (empty slot). A piece you are wearing is scored from its tooltip when the hunt list has no stored score for it. If the client has not loaded the item yet, the bar fills in when the item arrives. It does not stay 0.

**Hunt names match the tooltip color**

A hunt whose tooltip is green is green on the list. Sprightring Helm stayed blue on the list in v1.1.5 while the tooltip was already green, because the stored record was still the old rare item.

**Twisted Evils rewards use the green stats**

All nine classes were scored again from the current Forever tooltips. The four rewards from Twisted Evils in Maraudon are the green pieces, not the old blue ones.

Sprightring Helm is 106 armor, +11 Agility, and +16 Stamina. Combat ranks it 5th at 40–43, score 16.86. It was rank 1 at 22.47 on the old rare stats.

Hulkstone Pauldrons are 354 armor and +13 Stamina. The strength is gone. Arms ranks them 6th at 40–41, score 23.91. They were rank 1 at 36.06.

Acumen Robes are 64 armor, +15 Intellect, and +14 healing and spell damage. Holy ranks them 9th at 40–41, score 35.21. They were 3rd at 47.26.

Relentless Chain is 268 armor, +11 Stamina, +11 Intellect, and +20 Attack Power. It leaves the Beast Mastery chest list. Marksmanship ranks it 16th at 40–44, score 16.78. Survival ranks it 15th, score 18.28.

**No Dungeons hides a quest that enters a dungeon**

Quest rewards plus No Dungeons still showed a reward when the chain sends you into a dungeon before you get the item, including a chain that starts outside. Those hunts hide now. A world drop stays. An outdoor quest stays.

**Crafts both factions can make stay on both lists**

v1.1.5 filed some patterns under the Barrens camp. Alliance then lost the hunt, and wearing the piece scored 0. Brawler's Leather Hood and the other leather Pawani and Daniel Stitchsong both sell stay crafted hunts. The line names both sellers, and there is no faction zone on the hunt. A crafted Protector's, Sentinel's, or Champion's piece stays on both factions. Those words are also PvP ranks, and that rank gate does not apply to a pattern.

**Cat and bear weapons**

Bear prices weapon damage at 4.9, the same as cat. v1.1.5 had bear at 2.52. An on-hit weapon proc scores in cat and bear, because it fires in form. Druid was scored again. Heavehammer at 24 is still 153.64 for a bear.

**Map pins stay the size you pick**

Hunt settings has a map pin size from 50% to 150%. 100% is the normal icon. The icon keeps that size when the map zooms, including OpenMap. The zoomed-out map was drawing the icon gigantic.

**Minimap button collectors**

GearQuest adds a launcher button for addons that gather minimap buttons into one menu.

**Weight tooltip**

The spec weight tooltip says Melee weapon DPS and Ranged weapon DPS.

**Level up**

On a ding, the weapon lists are walked a few milliseconds at a time, so the weapon catalog is not one frame.

### v1.1.5

The window title reads **GearQuest Forever v1.1.5**. Crafted hunts Forever names are sourced again: 409 vendors, 101 boss drops, and 20 named creatures. Merchant's Favor leather from Pawani and Daniel Stitchsong, including Brawler's Leather Hood, is a vendor hunt. Veteran's Chain Helm lists the Stockade bosses. Veteran's Silvered Chain Helm is the camp recipe. Guise of Battle is a world drop at 40. Whitemane's Chapeau and Jumanza Grips use the current tooltips. Cat prices weapon damage at 4.9 and bear at 2.52, and an on-hit proc does not fire in form. Scout's Medallion and Sentinel's Medallion require Honored. Settings has a Donations page.

### v1.1.4

The window title reads **GearQuest Forever v1.1.4**. The knight's 13 pages are translated. Guild chat says once when a guild mate runs a newer version. The (i) list writes Equipped and the raw score. Show on map uses TomTom when it is installed and leaves the earlier TomTom pins. Enhancement intellect is 0.7 and is not doubled. Rage of the Storm and the other Tempest's Weapons are shaman only. A crafted hunt with no named seller is Unsourced, with no pin. 37 new Forever pieces are on the lists.

### v1.1.3

The window title reads **GearQuest Forever v1.1.3**. **Save and score items!** scores a custom spec with the numbers you typed, including the classic damage-and-healing line. An off-hand weapon uses the full weapon-damage weight. Healing stays 0 on a damage spec unless you type a number. For a priest, a mage, a warlock, a non-feral druid, and Elemental or Restoration, a one-hander is ranked with the best off-hand. Horde **Brutal Legguards**, **Brutal Gauntlets**, and **Brutal Hauberk** list the Speak with Ruga chain. The pin is the closest of Torm Ragetotem, Sorek, and Baltus Fowler. Brutal Legguards requires 20.

### v1.1.2

The window title reads **GearQuest Forever v1.1.2**. Quest reward adds **Quest chain** and **Single quest**. The parchment header, quest names, chain steps, and story use the selected language. **Stopping the Cycle** and **The Wrath of Rath'mael** keep their real chains. Hunt settings adds **Hide lower ranks** and **Hide map pins**. **No Zephras!** hides Skyborne-only hunts. A worn piece that is not on the list is not an empty slot. Beast Mastery 26–28 keeps the two-handers.

### v1.1.1

The window title reads **GearQuest Forever v1.1.1**. Settings has a Language menu, and GearQuest Forever: Languages carries French, German, Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Korean, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese. A fury warrior's off hand is a one-hand weapon from level 20, not a shield. Dungeon and raid trash and each profession use their own picture. Dropped plans point at the drop, not the capital trainer. Lookup stays inside the parchment. The GearQuest Community lists TheWawan.

### v1.1.0

The window title reads **GearQuest Forever v1.1.0**. Their Cities hides the other faction's city dungeons. Quest reward splits into Regular quest and Dungeon quest. 196 new Forever hunts were added, 33 of them quest rewards. Stopping the Cycle lists its eight steps, starting at the Tattered Spellbook in the Wetlands. Lookup, Removed, and tooltips were fixed.

### v1.0.9

The window title reads **GearQuest Forever v1.0.9**. Each hunt shows a small source picture. Horde hides The Stockade and Hall of Thanes. Alliance hides Ragefire Chasm and Ruins of Lordaeron. Hovers use the client tooltip, and the Wowhead Forever tip only when the client has no such item.

### v1.0.8

The window title reads **GearQuest Forever v1.0.8**. Hunt rows are two lines tall, and the parchment shows the full reward name. A quest chain lists every step, and a quest with no earlier step says there are no prequests. **Deviate Scale Belt** is the pattern from Deviate Eradication. A hunter ranks a one-hander in the main hand until Dual Wield at 20. A caster's one-hand rank names the off-hand it is worn with. The right stick opens a paper-doll slot. **Bladewhisper's Namesake** is a new thrown weapon, the Watcher's Signets were renamed, and 140 pieces left the lists.

### v1.0.7

The window title reads **GearQuest Forever v1.0.7**. Settings → The GearQuest Community now shows the current Discord invite, `https://discord.gg/gQSVunBsR`. That is the same link as on the CurseForge addon description. The old invite had expired.

### v1.0.6

The window title reads **GearQuest Forever v1.0.6**. The AddOn List shows the loot sack on GearQuest Forever, the same picture as the minimap button. Druid, Hunter, Mage, Paladin, Priest, Rogue, Shaman, Warlock, and Warrior each use that class's icon.

### v1.0.5

The window title reads **GearQuest Forever v1.0.5**. The **Hunts per gear slot** bar matches the hunt list, and a hovered hunt fades out to the right. **Play style** lines up with the parchment. The knight's bubble has no border, the speaker shows one, two, or three lines, and the tail stays on the portrait when the window is larger. Page 4 glows the Weapons filter. Deadlybrew is on **The GearQuest Community**.

### v1.0.4

The window title reads **GearQuest Forever v1.0.4**. **Hunts per gear slot** runs from 3 to 10 at the lower left of the log. The first time you open GearQuest, The GearQuest Knight speaks through 12 pages, with **Yes!** on the first page, a speaker and three volumes, and a gold glow on what he is explaining.

### v1.0.3

The window title reads **GearQuest Forever v1.0.3**. The reward name uses the item's rarity color. A flyout can select or clear every box on that list. A boss drop says **Recommended dungeon entry at level N.** The guide still finds the ship when the client is not English. **Garb of Florid Feathers**, **Raptorclaw Greaves**, **Raptor's Gaze**, **Glinteye Slippers**, **Saltscale Girdle**, and **Supple Bellyskin Leggings** drop in Excavation Site. **Pendulum of Doom** and **Annealed Blade** come from Uldaman. **Axe of Inevitable Ruin**, **Cloudkeeper Legplates**, **Changuk Smasher**, and **Rog'mar Trainee Shoulderpads** are on the lists.

### v1.0.2

The window title reads **GearQuest Forever v1.0.2**. While the log is open in gamepad UI, a gold chevron eases toward the focused control, a blue highlight marks it, and the window gets a soft gold glow. The d-pad and the left stick move through the hunts, the tabs, and Track, Show on map, and Remove. Y opens the filters without applying one. The bumpers change pages. A dark bar under the window names the buttons. The level box and the search box open the on-screen keyboard. Opening a Blizzard window gives that window the pad. **The GearQuest Community** lists Alteredigor.

### v1.0.1

The window title reads **GearQuest Forever v1.0.1**. **Hunts → Recommended gear enchantment** is off until you turn it on. The tooltip then says **Recommended enchantment** in yellow, then the formula and the effect in white, just above the rank line. A quest reward says **Recommended to pick this quest up at level M.** A rogue hunts every one-hand type in both hands. The log could already be opened with a controller.

### v1.0.0

This is the first release. The window title reads **GearQuest Forever v1.0.0**. The score bar says **Your GearQuest Index Score is N Rank**. Off-hand shields follow the source filter. City of Dalaran and the Ruins of Lordaeron name the attunement and the entrance. New Forever hunts include **Serrated Knife**.

### v0.6.1-beta

The window title reads **GearQuest Forever v0.6.1-beta**. Paladin and warrior levels 1–9 are scored per spec for both factions. Alliance Retribution hunts **Northshire Hammer**, **Empyrean Greatsword**, and **Ironforge Greathammer**. Horde Arms hunts **Rusty Cutlass**, **Goblin Smasher**, and **Riptear's Cleaver**. Turning the guide off frees the memory it used. **Recommended** follows the filters. **Dun Garok Rifle** and the Stormpike pieces are Horde only. **Friend of the Library** is both factions. **Ashbringer**, **Sulfuras**, and **Nature's Whisper** are on the lists. A priest, a mage, a warlock, and a balance or restoration druid start with two-hand and main hand both on. Hunters have Bow, Gun, and Crossbow on the Ranged header.

### v0.6.0-beta

You can make your own spec weights from **+ custom stat weights**. **Save and score items!** rebuilds that list, and the spinner stays on the GearQuest window. **Focus Zone** keeps hunts in the zone you are standing in. **Stormrider's Leather Pants** scores the damage-and-healing line as healing and damage. The window title reads **GearQuest Forever v0.6.0-beta**.

### v0.5.8-beta

**General → Window size** runs from 100% to 150%. A reputation vendor says the standing this character has. **Ratchet Wristwraps** says **Your standing is Neutral.** Auctionator prices sit under a hunt hover when that addon is on. Eight starter drops are green, including **Wispy Cloak** at 5 and **Ratty Old Belt** from Narg the Taskmaster. **The GearQuest Community** lists Thrayne. The window title reads **GearQuest Forever v0.5.8-beta**.

### v0.5.7-beta

The log has a **Lookup** tab. Quest text uses your character's name. **Wildhunter Cloak** no longer prints the code from the quest page. A piece you already have leaves the hunt list on that character only. **Hammerbone** on a druid does not hide it on a paladin. Protection and Shockadin score weapon speed at -2. **Manageable Dungeons** replaces Don't look back. A bind-on-equip craft stays under **Get it now**. Vendor prices use coin icons. 222 rare tooltips were checked against Wowhead Forever. **Rot-Covered Harpoon** and **Scoutmaster's Eyepatch** are uncommon. The minimap button sits on the rim. The window title reads **GearQuest Forever v0.5.7-beta**.

### v0.5.6-beta

Paladins have a fourth spec, **Shockadin**. Holy, Shockadin, Elemental, and Restoration hunt a two-hander and a one-hander together. Rogues can hunt one-hand axes. **Axe of the Deep Woods** is the Horde Combat main hand from 52 through 59. **Coldflame Saber** and **Blade of Silverlaine** match the Forever page. Ten new Forever pieces are on the lists, including **Firebird Leggings** at 43 and **Stone Keeper Spire** at 44. The Desolace centaur weapons require 35. The window title reads **GearQuest Forever v0.5.6-beta**.

### v0.5.5-beta

A vendor hunt names the person standing at the pin. **Dirty Leather Bracers** in Mulgore says **Bought from Varia Hardhide.** **Manageable Quests** hides a quest reward until the level you are viewing is 4 under that item's level. **Clergy Ring** can show from 18. The wait stops at 60. Leveling up, changing zone, and opening a cold log are spread across frames. The GearQuest index stays 0 to 100 at level 60. The window title reads **GearQuest Forever v0.5.5-beta**.


### v0.5.4-beta

Weapons have one filter: two-hand and one-hand, then the types in the current band. Rank numbers stay the real ones, and the (i) list stops at 30. Hunters can dual wield. Shamans cannot. **Invisible Dagger** and placeholder items are gone. The six camp leather chests and pants are bought from Pawani and Daniel Stitchsong. The score bar does not move when you filter weapons. **General → Hide chat messages** silences chat and leaves the log. A vendor only one faction sells stays off the other list. Protection paladin armor, spell power, and mana per 5 were rescored, and level 60 kept the leveling stamina and mana multipliers. The window title reads **GearQuest Forever v0.5.4-beta**.

### v0.5.3-beta

The hunt list shows an icon and a faded grey **#N** on every row, including **#4** and later. **Leafre's Ring** shows **#1** when that tooltip says it is first. A quest reward says **This quest can be picked up at level N.** **Windstorm Hammer** and **Dancing Flame** say 36. **Ragefire Wand**, **Icefury Wand**, and **Nether Force Wand** say 40. **Heart of Disruption** says 30. **- Recommended** skips an empty slot unless that piece's raw score beats the best upgrade in a slot that already has gear. On a level 11 Retribution paladin, **Hammerbone** is the hunt over **Talbar Mantle**. Hovering bags scores a slot once and does not load every other piece. **Armor of the Fang** is +3 Strength, +3 Intellect, and +10 Spirit. Beast Mastery and Marksmanship hunt the other Fang pieces from about 18 to 24. Survival and Feral keep the chest only through 21. Enhancement keeps it through 27. **Medal of Courage** requires 35. The five Zandalar wraps and robes require 58. The level 60 dungeon sets still require 60. The window title reads **GearQuest Forever v0.5.3-beta**.

### v0.5.2-beta

The log header shows a GearQuest Index Score bar while you are not simulating. Up to three rank #1 hunts are marked Recommended. Notables are gone. Heart of Disruption is the right faction, at level 30, pinned on the quest that starts the chain. The leather helms are boss drops. The guide samples your position every 5 seconds. The window title reads **GearQuest Forever v0.5.2-beta**.

### v0.5.1-beta

The hunt list marks **- Rank #1 BiS acquired** when you already have that slot's best piece, and **- Recommended** on the biggest rank #1 upgrade from what you are wearing. Rank lists count only hunts this character can get. The window title reads **GearQuest Forever v0.5.1-beta**.

Menethil Harbor, Southshore, and Auberdine are one Alliance ship. Stormwind Harbor and Auberdine are another. Steamwheedle Port and Powderfuse Port are one ship for both factions. Alliance skycutters run Valanaar to Dalaran. Horde zeppelins run Valanaar to Skywatcher Plateau. **Coldspire Staff** drops from Rath'Mael in the Ruins of Lordaeron and requires 19. Credits lists Click.

### v0.5.0-beta

Hover any piece of gear and the tooltip says **Rank #N for your level** and a GearQuest index from −100 to +100, with a green or red arrow against what you are wearing. **General → GearQuest score on tooltips** is on by default. The dungeon upgrade sets require 60, and the pin is An Earnest Proposition. Closing the world map with a gamepad no longer locks jump or talking to NPCs. The window title reads **GearQuest Forever v0.5.0-beta**.

### v0.4.2-beta

A tracked hunt can point the way. The arrow sits above the tracker, and dragging it moves the tracker. On another continent it aims at the boat or zeppelin and names the dock. `/reload` keeps the guided hunt. World-map pins use a different icon per source, including the sunset for a world drop. Through level 15 a generic world drop is pinned on a published mob: Kobold Vermin, Mottled Boar, Harvest Watcher, or Plainstrider. **Track** pulses gold the first time you can click it.

### v0.4.1-beta

Play style is five cards: **No Dungeons!**, **Dungeon Enjoyer**, **Get it now!**, **Don't look back**, and **Buy it**. The two dungeon cards turn each other off. The other three can be on with either. The green arrow stays on the real best pieces when a filter hides them, and on every hunt still showing. **Track** still toasts when you loot a hunt the list is hiding. A crafted hunt lists its materials. **Totemic Leather Hood** (Leatherworking 100) names Medium Leather, Cured Medium Hide, Pristine Leather, Fine Thread, and Sulfuric Acid. The skill line is green when you meet the recipe and red when you are short. **Dress Shoes** have no recipe. Reset on the Simulator returns the list to your character.

### v0.4.0-beta

**Play style** opened with **No Dungeons!** and **Get it now!**, and both could be on. The filter gained a profession list, a boss-drop dungeon list, and a separate trash list. The parchment shows **Rank #N** from the real slot rank. A crafted hunt states the recipe skill just before Source. **Windstorm Hammer** and **Dancing Flame** require **36**. **Ragefire Wand**, **Icefury Wand**, and **Nether Force Wand** require **40**. **Faded Hakkari Cloak** and **Tattered Hakkari Cape** require **58**. **Drakefire Amulet** requires **60**.

### v0.3.6-beta

Every class was scored again from the current Wowhead Forever tooltip. A reward that is new in Forever has a burnt mark beside the icon. Malignant Root and White Obsidian Wand have it. Blackened Defias Leggings does not. Holy paladin prefers healing mail and plate over cloth. Beast Mastery and Marksmanship no longer hunt Armor of the Fang. Survival and Feral keep Embrace of the Viper through 23. A gamepad no longer opens Blizzard's restrictions dialog on login.

### v0.3.5-beta

You can hold your hunts when you ding with **Enable Level Up On Demand**, then press **Level up!** when you are ready. **Apply filter** commits the source boxes at once. The simulator marks your faction and spec with a gold rim. The character panel's upgrade bar closes when you click outside it. **Goblin Hammer** is a Deadmines boss drop. A weapon whose tooltip says **Main Hand** is no longer an off-hand hunt. **Serrated Raptor Claw** is Horde only.


### v0.3.4-beta

Hunter ranged is bows, guns, and crossbows, ranked on the weapon's damage. Thrown weapons are not hunter hunts. Beast Mastery Horde at 22 is Alliance Outrunner Bow, Double-barreled Shotgun, and Naga Heartpiercer. At 26 it is Concealed Hand Crossbow, Dun Garok Rifle, and Outrider's Bow. Embrace of the Viper pins the Wailing Caverns entrance in the Barrens. Deadmines, Scarlet Monastery, Gnomeregan, Razorfen Kraul, Stratholme, Blackwing Lair, and Lord Kazzak have entrance pins. Simulation mode is yellow. Reset stays grey until you simulate. Hide upgrade arrows is on the Hunts page. GearQuest Commands is a settings page. Sharing a map pin no longer opens the Blizzard clipboard warning.

### v0.3.3-beta

Hunts with no known source are **Unsourced**, with no map pin. Dungeon bosses the tooltip already named are boss drops, pinned at the entrance, including Worgpelt Leggings in Shadowfang Keep. White Obsidian Wand, Unbreakable Golem Grips, Horseman's Unyielding Shroud, and Molok's Masher are hunts. Erudite's Amulet and Scholarly Pendant are greens. Priest, mage, and warlock wands rank on wand damage. Rotmender's Raiment and Embrace of the Viper count their set bonuses. **Removed** sits beside Active and Completed. Profession has a box per craft.

### v0.3.2-beta

The zone line names the parent zone. A quest reward with no Requires Level opens at the quest's pickup level. Fallen Guard's Pendant, Arcane Infused Rod, Restorer's Fine Gloves, Arena Master, and Dog Whistle are hunts.

### v0.3.1-beta

Hovers use the current Wowhead Forever tooltip. Dungeon bosses are boss drops. Open-world rares are Rare NPC, with a pin. Camp recipes point at the profession hubs. An Alliance-only quest stays off Horde.

### v0.3.0-beta

Hunts that have a place to go now say where, and **Show on map** opens that spot. Track and Untrack are one button. **Coldflame Saber** drops from Baron Silverlaine in Shadowfang Keep.

### v0.2.20-beta

Class art behind the log and the simulator class rows. Priest, mage, and warlock wands count damage from level 10. Greater Magic Wand is 17.5 dps. Lookie's Spyglass drops from Cookie. A green "of the …" hunt completes only when the full name matches.

### v0.2.19-beta

Weapon hovers show spell power again, and a hunt uses the tooltip's required level instead of item level. **Fang of Magmatus** requires **13**. Alliance Holy and Discipline: **Staff of Westfall** is main hand rank **1** from level **14**. Fishing follows the Profession filter. A name that was only "Item" plus a number uses the real item name.


### v0.2.18-beta

GearQuest loads one class at a time, so it uses far less memory. Hovers that used to say **Not found in the client** now show the Wowhead Forever tooltip. A toast only fires for a top upgrade, the notable, or a hunt you are tracking at your current level. **Wyvern Heart Band** is finger rank 1 from level 29 through 37 for Arms, Fury, Retribution, Combat, Subtlety, Survival, and Feral, and through 47 for Assassination.

### v0.2.17-beta

Hover the spec name or icon to see how that spec is scored. Below 60, Enhancement shaman intellect counts at **1.2**. **Wolfsbane** is Horde Retribution main hand rank 1 from level 20 through 26.

### v0.2.16-beta

The window title reads **GearQuest Forever** plus the version. Gear you already have stays on **Completed** when a source filter is on. After `/gq wipe data`, jumping the simulator to a higher level marks the pieces you are wearing as completed again.

### v0.2.15-beta

Profession windows stay responsive. A piece you already carry or wear leaves **Active** and sits on **Completed**. Horde lists no longer show Alliance-only librams or Stormwind quests. **Snake Eye Kaleidoscope** is a neck hunt from level 17 while it stays in the top three.

### v0.2.14-beta

Settings can hide the minimap icon. Set pieces are marked **(Set piece)**. **Embrace of the Viper** is the Wailing Caverns hunt for hunter, rogue, Enhancement, and Feral in the high teens and twenties. **Defias Leather** is legs at 14–15 and boots at 15–16 for rogues. **Chain of the Scarlet Crusade** ranks on its own stats for Retribution, Arms, Fury, and Protection around the low 30s.

### v0.2.13-beta

An upgrade toasts once, the first time it lands in your bags or on your character.

### v0.2.12-beta

Worn gear shows beside a hunt tooltip. Bag clicks and the profession book work again. Completed opens without freezing. Dungeon hunts name the boss, including Witherfang, The Baron, Magmatus, and Plunder. A spec you pick stays on this character. Duty Bound Leggings and Remembrance Armor are Alliance only. Heat Resistant Mitts and Safety Boots are Horde only.

### v0.2.11-beta

The source filter hides World drop, Boss drop, Raid trash, Quest reward, Seasonal quest, Vendor, Profession, Container, and Special. Quest rewards and vendor gear use the source you can actually use. **Healing Done** counts for healers. Damage specs score **+Damage Done** as spell power. Completed is per character.

### v0.2.10-beta

Your talent tree picks the spec again after `/reload`. The log spec menu is for this session. Wowhead PvP stats were refreshed, and **Death Prophet Spine** is an Enhancement shaman hunt at 26.

### v0.2.9-beta

Crafted hunts name who sells the recipe. Horde buys from Durotar Supply and Logistics in The Barrens. Alliance buys from Azeroth Commerce Authority in Redridge Mountains.

### v0.2.8-beta

Mage **Battle Mage** is in the spec menu. **Coldflame Saber** is the mage main hand from level 21, using the Forever client tooltip. The imbue line reads **Use: Combine the Blade of Silverlaine and Imbue Blade.**

### v0.2.7-beta

Talking to a profession trainer no longer freezes the client. GearQuest does not scan trainers for new items.

### v0.2.6-beta

Hunt tooltips follow Wowhead Forever, including set layout and quality color. **Enhancement Tank** is a one-hand and shield hunt: stamina and armor first, then threat.

### v0.2.5-beta

Leveling hunts rank damage first, then stamina and armor, then mana. A random-enchant green is ranked on its best suffix, not the average roll. Warrior Protection does not score spell power. **Silvered Gauntlets** are the Protection hands notable.

### v0.2.4-beta

Random-enchant greens show the suffix on the item tooltip, not only in the hunt text.

### v0.2.3-beta

Repo-only follow-up. The in-game build matches v0.2.2-beta.

### v0.2.2-beta

Lists aim for three different names per slot. Totem, idol, and libram hunts score the effect on the tooltip. The simulator has a faction dropdown.

### v0.2.1-beta

**Mirror of Rath'mael** was the new Wowhead piece. The “ring slot eligible” toast no longer fires for Horde characters who have no ring hunts at level 9.

### v0.2.0-forever-beta

Warsong Gulch rune trinkets are hunts for both factions from level 20. Classic items Wowhead Forever does not have are dropped from the lists.

### v0.1.0-beta.6-forever

The log uses the profession-style window. Hunt names come from stored facts, so login no longer requests every item. Early hunts are scored per spec.

### v0.1.0-beta.5-forever

Same Horde notes as beta.4. The CurseForge upload no longer breaks on changelog punctuation.

### v0.1.0-beta.4-forever

Horde phase-4 quest and crafted pieces compete on the generated lists.

### v0.1.0-beta.3-forever

CurseForge target is WoW Forever 1.60.1.

### v0.1.0-beta.2-forever

First zip that actually contained the addon.

### v0.1.0-beta.1-forever

First CurseForge beta, project **1698950**. Two-column log, Active and Completed, simulator capped at 60. The folder name is **GearQuestForever**, separate from TBC GearQuest. Lists are Classic-era, level 60, not TBC level 70.
